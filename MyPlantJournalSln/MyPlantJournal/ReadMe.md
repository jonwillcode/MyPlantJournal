# My Plant Journal (Development in progress)

Add your plants to your virtual garden and get reminders when each plant needs to be checked to be watered, keep a history of care to your beautiful plant, and store information about it that can be shared with others who may be caring for lovely indoor or outdoor plants. 

It's not a requirement, but are you using this app for succulents? Great! When you propagate, you can easily copy information from the parent plant (like its species, care information, schedules, and more) to the child plant for to easily keep track of your whole plant family.
